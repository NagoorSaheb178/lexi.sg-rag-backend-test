LEGAL DOCUMENT: VEHICLE PERMIT REQUIREMENTS AND INSURANCE LIABILITY

STATUTORY FRAMEWORK:
Under the Motor Vehicles Act, all commercial transport vehicles must obtain valid permits before operating on public roads. This requirement is fundamental to ensuring road safety, proper taxation, and regulatory compliance.

PERMIT REQUIREMENTS:
1. All transport vehicles must have valid permits before operation
2. Permits must be renewed within specified time periods
3. Operation without permit constitutes a statutory violation
4. Permits are distinct from vehicle registration and driver licensing

INSURANCE LIABILITY PRINCIPLES:
The relationship between vehicle permits and insurance coverage is governed by established legal principles:

FUNDAMENTAL STATUTORY INFRACTIONS:
When a vehicle operates without a valid permit, it constitutes a fundamental statutory infraction. This is distinguished from other violations such as:
- Driving without a license
- Using a fake license
- Driving with wrong class of license
- Overloading violations
- Speed limit violations

INSURANCE COMPANY RIGHTS:
Insurance companies are entitled to deny compensation claims when vehicles operate in violation of fundamental statutory requirements. The Supreme Court has established that:

1. Use of vehicle without permit is a fundamental breach
2. Insurance companies can recover compensation from owners and drivers
3. Such violations void the insurance company's obligation to pay
4. The principle applies specifically to permit-related violations

LEGAL PRECEDENT:
Courts have consistently held that insurance companies bear no liability when transport vehicles operate without valid permits. This principle protects insurance companies from claims arising from fundamental statutory violations.

PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS:
- Vehicle owners must ensure valid permits before operation
- Insurance companies can investigate permit status before settling claims
- Victims may need to pursue compensation directly from vehicle owners
- Permit violations can result in both criminal and civil liability

CONCLUSION:
The law clearly establishes that operating a transport vehicle without a valid permit creates a fundamental statutory violation that relieves insurance companies of their obligation to pay compensation for accidents.
