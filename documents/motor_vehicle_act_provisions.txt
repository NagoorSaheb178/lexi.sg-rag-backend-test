MOTOR VEHICLE ACT: PERMIT PROVISIONS AND INSURANCE REGULATIONS

CHAPTER VII: PERMITS FOR TRANSPORT VEHICLES

Section 66: Necessity for Permit
(1) No owner of a transport vehicle shall use or permit the use of the vehicle in any public place whether or not such vehicle is actually carrying any passengers or goods save in accordance with the conditions of a permit granted or countersigned by a Regional Transport Authority or State Transport Authority.

(2) Any person who contravenes the provisions of sub-section (1) shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term which may extend to three months or with fine which may extend to five thousand rupees or with both.

Section 67: Application for Permit
Every application for a permit shall be made to the Regional Transport Authority of the region in which it is proposed to use the vehicle or to the State Transport Authority.

INSURANCE LIABILITY FRAMEWORK:

The Motor Vehicle Act establishes clear distinctions between different types of violations:

CLASS A VIOLATIONS (Fundamental Statutory Infractions):
- Operating without valid permit
- Using vehicle for unauthorized purpose
- Exceeding territorial limits without authorization

CLASS B VIOLATIONS (License-Related Issues):
- Driving without license
- Driving with expired license
- Using fake or forged license
- Driving with wrong class of license

CLASS C VIOLATIONS (Operational Violations):
- Overloading
- Speed violations
- Route deviations
- Time restrictions violations

INSURANCE COMPANY OBLIGATIONS:

Under Section 149 of the Motor Vehicle Act, insurance companies are liable to pay compensation except in cases of fundamental statutory violations. The Act specifically provides that:

1. Insurance companies cannot avoid liability for Class B and Class C violations
2. However, Class A violations (including permit violations) constitute fundamental breaches
3. Such breaches void the insurance company's obligation to compensate victims
4. The owner and driver remain personally liable for damages

JUDICIAL INTERPRETATION:

Courts have consistently held that the absence of a valid permit is a fundamental statutory infraction that:
- Goes to the root of the vehicle's authorization to operate
- Cannot be equated with licensing or operational violations
- Provides complete defense to insurance companies
- Shifts liability entirely to vehicle owners and drivers

PRACTICAL ENFORCEMENT:

Law enforcement agencies and courts must distinguish between:
- Technical violations (correctable defects)
- Operational violations (procedural non-compliance)
- Fundamental violations (complete absence of authorization)

Operating without a permit falls squarely within the fundamental violation category, making it a complete bar to insurance company liability.

CONCLUSION:

The Motor Vehicle Act creates a clear hierarchy of violations, with permit-related infractions constituting the most serious category that completely absolves insurance companies of liability while maintaining the personal liability of vehicle owners and operators.
